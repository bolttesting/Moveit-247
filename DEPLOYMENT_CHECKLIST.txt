🚀 QUICK START GUIDE
--------------------
1. ⚠️  You NEED VPS/Cloud Hosting (NOT regular hosting!)
   - Regular hosting (public_html) = PHP only
   - Your app = Node.js = Needs VPS

2. Purchase Hostinger VPS ($4.99/month minimum)
   - https://www.hostinger.com/vps-hosting

3. Get SSH access from Hostinger panel

4. Upload files using FileZilla:
   - Host: sftp://your-server-ip
   - Port: 22
   - Upload to: /var/www/moveit247

5. SSH into server and run:
   ```
   cd /var/www/moveit247
   npm install
   pm2 start server.js --name moveit247
   pm2 save
   ```

6. Setup domain in Hostinger DNS:
   - A Record → Your VPS IP

7. Done! Visit your domain
