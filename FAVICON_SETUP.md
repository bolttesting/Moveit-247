2. **`favicon-32x32.png`** - 32x32 pixels (browser tab icon)
3. **`apple-touch-icon.png`** - 180x180 pixels (iPhone home screen icon) ⭐ **Most Important**
4. **`favicon-192x192.png`** - 192x192 pixels (Android/PWA icon)
5. **`favicon-512x512.png`** - 512x512 pixels (Android/PWA icon)

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Apple Touch Icon (180x180)**: This is REQUIRED for iPhone home screen icons
- The SVG favicon works immediately, but PNG icons provide better compatibility
- Clear browser cache if icons don't update immediately
- iPhone caches icons, so you may need to remove and re-add to home screen

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

**Icons not showing?**
1. Clear browser cache
2. Check file names are exact (case-sensitive)
3. Check files are in root directory
4. Restart server
5. Hard refresh: Ctrl+F5 (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)

**iPhone icon not updating?**
1. Remove app from home screen
2. Clear Safari cache
3. Add to home screen again

**404 errors for icon files?**
- Check server.js serves static files correctly (already configured)
- Verify files are in root directory, not in subdirectories
