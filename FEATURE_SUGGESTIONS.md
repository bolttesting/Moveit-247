        from: 'whatsapp:+14155238886',
        to: `whatsapp:${to}`,
        body: message
    });
};

// Send booking confirmation
sendWhatsApp('+971501234567',

    // Distance
    basePrice += data.distance * 2; // 2 AED per km
    
    // Apartment size
    const sizeMultiplier = {
        'studio': 1,
        '1br': 1.5,
        '2br': 2,
        '3br': 2.5,
        'villa': 3
    };
    basePrice *= sizeMultiplier[data.size] || 1;
    
    // Floor (no elevator)
    if (!data.elevator) {
        basePrice += data.floor * 50;
    }
    
    // Packing service
    if (data.packing) {
        basePrice += 300;
    }
